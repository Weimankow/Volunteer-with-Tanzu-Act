# Volunteer With Tanzu Act
Readme for developers or organisations interested in volunteering engineering support to help build and maintain non-profit sites and apps.

## What's this about?

[Tanzu Act](https://tanzu.vmware.com/act) (previously known as Pivotal Act) has worked with non-profits internationally to help them with digital solutions to problems like human trafficking, empowering youth, and connecting caregivers with help during covid.

A problem we've found is that after building apps or sites for non-profits, they tend to have trouble maintaining them, as they don't have a development team or expertise within their company.

We're experimenting with a model of having an engineer or an organisation adopt a non-profit to help with site maintainence.
