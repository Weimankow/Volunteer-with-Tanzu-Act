# Volunteer With Tanzu Act
Readme for developers or organisations interested in volunteering engineering support to help build and maintain non-profit sites and apps.

The volunteer will work with our engineers on and off on building the app or site, so that they are familiar with the code base, and get to learn and practice pair programming on a real life project in Tanzu Labs.

When our engagement with the non-profit ends, 

## What do I need to be aware of?
